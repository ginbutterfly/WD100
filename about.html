 	 	<p><strong> About Ginger</strong></p>
 	 	

 	 	<p>I'm currently enrolled in part-time Web Development 100 at NYCDA.</p>

 	 	<img src="images/liupost.png" class="img-post"/><p class="paragraph">I'm an accountant by day. I graduated in 2002 with a BS in Accounting from Long Island University - CW Post Campus (now known as LIU Post.)</p>

 	 	<img src="images/kittymimi.png" class="img-sanrio"/><p>I'm a huge fan of Hello Kitty and most things Sanrio.</p> 
 	 	<p class="paragraph">I am sure that growing up in Queens in the 80s is a huge contributor to that!</p>

 	 	<img src="images/EmmaSnow.jpg" class="img-emma"/><p>I'm the owner of a sweet Cavalier King Charles Spaniel named Emma.  I am a huge animal-lover. I grew up with cats but had a dog as a teen. Emma was my first puppy and a huge learning experience!  But because I had her since she was only 7 weeks old, I feel like she also opened up my heart in a way different from the other pets.</p>
