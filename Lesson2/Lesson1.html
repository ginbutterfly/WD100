		<p>From Yelp Support Center:</p>

    	<p>The Yelp Elite Squad is our way of recognizing people who are active in the Yelp community and role models on and off the site. Elite-worthiness is based on a number of things, including well-written reviews, high quality tips, a detailed personal profile, an active voting and complimenting record, and a hishttps://www.yelp.com/elitetory of playing well with others.</p>

		<p>Elite-worthiness is based on well-written reviews, high quality photos, an active voting and complimenting record, and a history of playing well with others.</p>

		<h2>My Elite Story</h2>

		<p>I was born and raised in Queens (melting pot of the world!) and come from a mixed ethnic background.  My brother and I were exposed to food from varied cultures (including our own).  And unlike many children, we ate everything that was served to us and enjoyed everything we ate!</p>

		<p>This only evolved in adulthood as we increased our circles of friends and eventually the word "Foodie" was used by many to describe me to others.</p>

		<p>Some cringe at the term (not sure why?) while the rest of us consider it a like interest and use it as an excuse to bond. ("YOU'RE a Foodie too? We HAVE to hang out!  I could use a new Food Buddy and I've been craving ramen lately.")</p>

		<em>For those still cringing at my "FOODIE" title... see <a href="#references"> Additional Useful Information </a> below
		</em>

		<p>Eventually I discovered <a href="https://www.yelp.com" target="_blank">Yelp</a> and decided to not only use it as a reference, but to put my experiences to good use by adding to the reviews and photos of restaurants that I, myself relied on from others.</p>

		<p>At some point it came up that a couple of friends are Yelp Elite members, and one of them was honestly in total shock that I never heard of it.  ("What do you mean YOU aren't ELITE? You get invited to all these food and drink tasting events for FREE!")</p>

		<h2>My First Ever Elite Squad Event: "Barnstorming Bareburger"</h2>

		<p>After over a year of "Elite" status, I FINALLY was accepted to an Elite event that didn't have a conflict with my schedule.  Instead of just having a private area/back room in a Bareburger for our event, we SHUT THE PLACE DOWN!  That's right, there was a sign on the door that the Bareburger location was closed for the evening for a private party, and I was invited! (Not to sound TOO smug or anything!)</p>

		<p>In the event description, we were informed "Elite Squad members will be tasting burgers, apps, salads, desserts and drinks!"</p>

		<p>I did NOT expect how much we were actually going to be sampling... evidence below:</p>
